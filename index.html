            <p class="para">Hey everyone! My name is Davis. I am an Operations Manager for a local intellectual property
                consulting firm in Austin, TX. I love playing basketball, binging Netflix, playing video games
                and going to the gym. I also have recently taken up a passion in web developement. While I am
                at the beginning of my journey learning the ropes, I hope to achieve a great deal.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="para">One interesting fact about me is my height. I currently stand at around 6'4 ~ 6'5.
                However, up until about my junior year of high school, I was 5'8. So from the age of 17 to 20 I grew
                around 11 inches which is highly irregular.
